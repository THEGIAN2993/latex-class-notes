\begin{abstract}
    This is the Cal Poly Algebra Test Bank. Beginning with the September 2025 exam, all problems will be drawn from a public "problem bank." This bank contains two types of problems: template problems and pool problems. \textbf{Template problems} are generally computational with easily adjustable specifics. These types of problems are especially prevalent in linear algebra. \textbf{Pool problems} make up the rest of the problem bank, and include all problems that are not easily adjustable. These problems, when chosen, will usually be asked as is.

    \begin{exercise}
        Let $G$ be a group. Prove that $G$ is non-cyclic if and only if $G$ is the union of its proper subgroups.
    \end{exercise} 
        {\color{blue} \begin{proof}
            ($\Rightarrow$) Suppose that $G$ is non-cyclic. Let $a \in G$. Since $G \neq \langle a \rangle$, there exists $a_2 \in G$ such that $a_2 \in G \setminus \langle a_1 \rangle$. If $G = \langle a_1 \rangle \cup \langle a_2 \rangle$, then we are done. If not, then find $a_3 \in G$ such that $a_3 \in G \setminus \left(\langle a_1 \rangle \cup \langle a_2 \rangle\right)$. Inductively, we have that $G = \bigcup_{i \in I}\langle a_i \rangle$

            ($\Leftarrow$) Let $\{H_i\}_{i \in I}$ be the family of proper subgroups of $G$. Suppose $G = \bigcup_{i \in I}H_i$. Let $a \in G$ be arbitrary. Then $a \in H_i$ for some $i \in I$. It must be the case that $\langle a \rangle \subseteq H_i$; i.e., $G \neq \langle a \rangle$. Thus $G$ is non-cyclic.
        \end{proof}}

    \begin{exercise}
        Let $G$ be a group, and $G\times G$ the direct product. The set $D=\{(g,g)\mid g\in G\}$ is a subgroup of $G\times G$. Prove that if $D$ is normal in $G\times G$ then $G$ is abelian.
    \end{exercise}
        {\color{blue} \begin{proof}
            If $D$ is normal in $G \times G$, then for all $(a,b) \in G$ and $(g,g) \in D$:
                \begin{equation*}
                \begin{split}
                    (a,b)(g,g)(a,b)^{-1} \in D
                    & \iff (aga^{-1},bgb^{-1}) \in D \\
                    & \iff aga^{-1} = bgb^{-1}.
                \end{split}
                \end{equation*}
            Take $g = b$. Then $aba^{-1} = bbb^{-1}$, which simplifies to $ab = ba$. Thus $G$ is abelian.
        \end{proof}}

    \begin{exercise}
        The dihedral group, $D_8$, is the group of eight rigid symmetries of a square. Prove that $D_8$ is not the internal direct product of two of its proper subgroups.
    \end{exercise}

    \begin{exercise}
        Let $G$ be a finite group and $H,K\mathrel{\unlhd}G$ be normal subgroups of relatively prime order. Prove that $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $G/H\times G/K$.
    \end{exercise}

    \begin{exercise}
        Suppose $G$ is a group that contains normal subgroups $H,K\unlhd G$ with $H\cap K=\{e\}$ and $HK=G$. Prove that $G\cong H\times K$.
    \end{exercise}
        \begingroup\color{blue}
        \begin{proof}
            We will first show that if $H,K \unlhd G$ with $H\cap K=\{e\}$, then $hk = kh$ for all $h \in H$ and $k \in K$. Since $K \unlhd G$, $hkh^{-1} \in K$. Thus $hkh^{-1}k^{-1} \in K$. Since $H \unlhd G$, $kh^{-1}k^{-1} \in H$. Thus $hkh^{-1}k^{-1} \in H$. Since $hkh^{-1}k^{-1} \in H \cap K$, it must be the case that $hkh^{-1}k^{-1} = e_G$. Thus $hk = kh$.

            Define $\varphi:HK \rightarrow H \times K$ by $hk \mapsto (h,k)$. We can see $\varphi$ is a homomorphism since:
                \begin{equation*}
                \begin{split}
                    \varphi(h_1k_1 h_2 k_2)
                    & = \varphi(h_1 h_2 k_1 k_2) \\
                    & = (h_1 h_2 , k_1 k_2) \\
                    & = (h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2) \\
                    & = \varphi(h_1k_1)\varphi(h_2 k_2).
                \end{split}
                \end{equation*}
            Now suppose $\varphi(h_1 k_1) = \varphi(h_2 k_2)$. Then $(h_1,k_1) = (h_2,k_2)$. It must be the case that $h_1 = h_2$ and $k_1 = k_2$. Thus $h_1k_1 = h_2k_2$; i.e., $\varphi$ is injective. Furthermore, given any $(h,k) \in H \times K$, we have $\varphi(hk) = (h,k)$, hence $\varphi$ is surjective. Thus $\varphi$ is an isomorphism, so $HK = G \cong H \times K$. \qedhere

    \begin{exercise}
        Let $G$ be the group of upper-triangular real matrices $\bmat a & b \\ 0 & d\emat$ with $a,d\neq 0$, under matrix multiplication. Let $S$ be the subset of $G$ defined by $d=1$. Show that $S$ is normal and that $G/S\cong {\bfR}^{\times}$, the multiplicative group of nonzero real numbers.
    \end{exercise}

    \begin{exercise}
        Let $G$ be a group and suppose $\operatorname{Aut}(G)$ is trivial.
            \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
                \item Show that $G$ is abelian.
                \item Show that for any abelian group $H$, the {\bfseries inversion map} $\phi(h)=h^{-1}$ is an automorphism.
                \item Use parts (a) and (b) above to show that $g^2$ is the identity element for every $g\in G$.
            \end{enumerate}
    \end{exercise}
        {\color{blue} \begin{proof}
            (a) Let $h \in G$ be arbitrary. Define $\varphi_h:G \rightarrow G$ by $\varphi_h(g) = hgh^{-1}$. Let $g_1,g_2 \in G$. The map $\varphi_h$ is a homomorphism since:
                \begin{equation*}
                \begin{split}
                    \varphi_h(g_1 g_2)
                    & = h g_1 g_2 h^{-1} \\
                    & = h g_1 h^{-1} h g_2 h^{-1} \\
                    & = \varphi(g_1)\varphi(g_2).
                \end{split}
                \end{equation*}
            Now suppose $\varphi(g_1) = \varphi(g_2)$. Then $hg_1h^{-1} = hg_2h^{-1}$, which simplifies to $g_1 = g_2$. Hence $\varphi$ is injective. Furthermore, given $g \in G$, $\varphi(h^{-1}gh) = hh^{-1}ghh^{-1} = g$; i.e., $\varphi$ is surjective. Thus $\varphi_h \in \Aut(G)$. Since $\Aut(G)$ is trivial, $\varphi_h$ must be the identity map. Hence $g = hgh^{-1}$, or equivalently $gh = hg$. Thus $G$ is abelian.

            (b) The map $\Phi:H \rightarrow H$ defined by $h \mapsto h^{-1}$ is a homomorphism since:
                \begin{equation*}
                \begin{split}
                    \Phi(h_1 h_2)
                    & = (h_1h_2)^{-1} \\
                    & = h_2^{-1}h_1^{-1} \\
                    & = h_1^{-1}h_2^{-1}.
                \end{split}
                \end{equation*}
            Furthermore, if $\Phi(h_1) = \Phi(h_2)$, then $h_1^{-1} = h_2^{-1}$ Equivalently, $h_1^{-1}h_2 = e_H$, which yields $h_2 = h_1$. Thus $\Phi$ is injective. Furthermore, for any $h \in H$, $\Phi(h^{-1}) = (h^{-1})^{-1} = h$. Thus $\Phi \in \Aut(H)$.

            (c) Let $\Phi:G \rightarrow G$ be defined by $\Phi(g) = g^{-1}$. Since $G$ is abelian, part (b) gives $\Phi \in \Aut(G)$. Since $\Aut(G)$ is trivial, $\Phi$ is the identity map. Hence $g = g^{-1}$, which is equivalent to $g^2 = e_G$
        \end{proof}}

    \begin{exercise}
        \phantom{a}
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item Suppose $N$ is a normal subgroup of a group $G$ and $\pi_N:G\to G/N$ is the usual projection homomorphism, defined by $\pi_N(g)=gN$. Prove that if $\phi:G\to H$ is any homomorphism with $N\leq \ker(\phi)$, then there exists a unique homomorphism $\psi:G/N\to H$ such that $\phi = \psi\circ \pi_N$. (You must explicitly define $\psi$, show it is well-defined, show $\phi=\psi\circ\pi_N$, and show that $\psi$ is uniquely determined.)
            \item Prove the Third Isomorphism Theorem: if $M, N\unlhd G$ with $N\leq M$, then $(G/N)/(M/N)\cong G/M$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{exercise}

    \begin{exercise}
        Let $G$ be a group and $a \in G$ be an element. Let $n \in \bfN$ be the smallest positive number such that $a^n = e$, where $e$ is the identity element. Show that the set $\{e,a,a^2,...,a^{n-1}\}$ contains no repetitions.
    \end{exercise}
        {\color{blue} \begin{proof}
            Suppose $a^i = a^j$ where $0 \leq i < n$ and $0 \leq j < n$. Then $a^{i-j} = e$. Since $0 \leq i < n$ and $0 \leq j < n$, it must be that $i-j < n$. But since $n$ is the smallest positive number such that $a^n = e$, it must be the case that $i-j = 0$. Hence $i = j$.
        \end{proof}}

    \begin{exercise}
        Let $G$ be a finite abelian group of odd order. Let $\phi:G\to G$ be the function defined by $\phi(g)=g^2$ for all $g\in G$. Prove that $\phi$ is an automorphism.
    \end{exercise}
        {\color{blue} \begin{proof}
            Let $g,h \in G$. The map $\phi$ is a homomorphism since:
                \begin{equation*}
                \begin{split}
                    \phi(gh)
                    & = (gh)^2 \\
                    & = g^2 h^2 \h9\text{\tiny Since $G$ is abelian} \\
                    & = \phi(g)\phi(h).
                \end{split}
                \end{equation*}
            Now suppose $\phi(g) = \phi(h)$. Then $g^2 = h^2$, or equivalently $(gh^{-1})^2 = e_G$. Since $G$ is of odd order, it must be the case that $gh^{-1} = e_G$; i.e., $g = h$. Thus $\phi$ is injective.

            Suppose the order of $G$ is $2k-1$ for some $k \geq 1$. Let $g \in G$. Then $g^k \in G$. Observe that $\phi(g^k) = g^{2k} = g g^{2k-1} = g$, hence $\phi$ is surjective. Thus $\phi \in \Aut(G)$.
        \end{proof}}

    \begin{exercise}
        Let $\bfZ/n\bfZ$ denote the cyclic group of order $n$. Suppose $m \in \bfN$ is relatively prime to $n$. Define the function $\mu_m:\bfZ/n\bfZ \rightarrow \bfZ/n\bfZ$ by $\mu([a]_n) = [ma]_n$.
        \begin{enumerate}[label = (\arabic*),itemsep=1pt,topsep=3pt]
            \item Prove that the map $\mu_m$ is a well-defined automorphism of $\bfZ/n\bfZ$.
            \item Prove that any automorphism of $\bfZ/n\bfZ$ has the form $\mu_m$ for some $m$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{exercise}

    \begin{exercise}
        For a group $G$ and an element $g \in G$, the \textit{centralizer} of $g$ in $G$ is the subgroup:
            \begin{equation*}
            \begin{split}
                C_G(g) = \{h \in G \mid hgh^{-1} = g\}.
            \end{split}
            \end{equation*}
        We say $g$ and $g'$ are \textit{conjugate in $G$} if there exists an element $h \in G$ such that $g' = hgh^{-1}$.

        Suppose $S_n$ is a symmetric group with $n \geq 4$, and $\sigma$ is one of the $(n-2)$-cycles in $S_n$ (There are $\frac{n!}{2(n-2)}$ such cycles). 
            \begin{enumerate}[label = (\roman*),itemsep=1pt,topsep=3pt]
                \item Prove that $[S_n : C_{S_n}(\sigma)] = [A_n:C_{A_n}(\sigma)]$.
                \item Determine whether all $(n-2)$-cycles are conjugate in $A_n$.
            \end{enumerate}
    \end{exercise}

    \begin{exercise}
        Let $G$ be a finite group and $n > 1$ an integer such that $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$ for all $a,b \in G$. Let 
            \begin{equation*}
            \begin{split}
                G_n = \{c \in G \mid c^n = e\}, \h9 G^n = \{c^n \mid c \in G\}.
            \end{split}
            \end{equation*}
        You may take for granted that these are subgroups. Prove that $G_n$ and $G^n$ are normal in $G$, and $|G^n| = [G : G_n]$.
    \end{exercise}
        {\color{blue} \begin{proof}
            Let $g \in G$ and $c \in G_n$. Observe that:
                \begin{equation*}
                \begin{split}
                    (gcg^{-1})^n 
                    & = g^n c^n (g^{-1})^n \\
                    & = g^n (g^{-1})^n \\
                    & = (g g^{-1})^n \\
                    & = e.
                \end{split}
                \end{equation*}
            Thus $gcg^{-1} \in G_n$, so $G_n \unlhd G$. Let $g \in G$ and $h \in G^n$. Then $h = c^n$ for some $c \in G$. Observe that:
                \begin{equation*}
                \begin{split}
                    ghg^{-1} 
                    & = gc^n g^{-1} \\
                    & = g\underbrace{c...c}_{\text{$n$ times}}g^{-1} \\
                    & = \underbrace{(gcg^{-1})(gcg^{-1})...(gcg^{-1})}_{\text{$n$ times}} \\
                    & = (gcg^{-1})^n \\
                \end{split}
                \end{equation*}
            Thus $ghg^{-1} \in G^n$, so $G^n \unlhd G$.

            Define $\varphi:G \rightarrow G$ by $\varphi(g) = g^n$. The First Isomorphism Theorem says that $G/\ker{\varphi} \cong \Image{\varphi}$. Observe that:
                \begin{equation*}
                \begin{split}
                    \ker \varphi
                    & = \{g \in G \mid \varphi(g) = e\} \\
                    & = \{g \in G \mid g^n = e\} \\
                    & = G_n. \\
                    &\phantom = \\
                    \Image \varphi &= \{\varphi(g) \mid g \in G\} \\
                    & = \{g^n \mid g \in G\} \\
                    & = G^n.
                \end{split}
                \end{equation*}
            Thus $G/G_n \cong G^n$. Hence $|G^n| = |G/G_n| = [G:G_n]$.
        \end{proof}}

    \begin{exercise}
        Suppose $G$ is a group, $H \leq G$ a subgroup, and $a,b \in G$. Prove that the following are equivalent:
            \begin{enumerate}[label = (\arabic*),itemsep=1pt,topsep=3pt]
                \item $aH = bH$;
                \item $b \in aH$;
                \item $b^{-1}a \in H$.
            \end{enumerate}
    \end{exercise}
        {\color{blue} \begin{proof}
            (1)$\Rightarrow$(2) Note that $b = b e_G \in bH$. Since $aH = bH$, $b \in aH$.

            (2)$\Rightarrow(3)$ If $b \in aH$, then $b = ah$ for some $h \in H$. Equivalently, $h^{-1} = b^{-1}a$. Since $h^{-1} \in H$, $b^{-1}a \in H$.

            (3)$\Rightarrow$(1) First, note that $b^{-1}a \in H$ implies $b^{-1}a = h$ for some $h \in H$. Then $(b^{-1}a)^{-1} = h^{-1}$, which simplifies to $a^{-1}b = h^{-1}$. Hence $a^{-1}b \in H$. Let $x \in aH$. Then $x = ah$ for some $h \in H$. This is equivalent to $x = bb^{-1}ah$. Since $b^{-1}ah \in H$, $x \in bH$. Now let $y \in bH$. Then $y = bh$ for some $h \in H$. This is equivalent to $y = aa^{-1}bh$. Since $a^{-1}bh \in H$, $y \in aH$. Thus $aH = bH$.

    \begin{exercise}
        Suppose $G$ is a nontrivial finite group and $H,K \unlhd G$ are normal subgroups with $\gcd \left( |H|,|K| \right) = 1$.
            \begin{enumerate}[label = (\arabic*),itemsep=1pt,topsep=3pt]
                \item Define a nontrivial group homomorphism $\phi:G \rightarrow G/H \times G/K$.
                \item Prove $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $G/H \times G/K$
                \item Suppose $\gcd(m,n) = 1$. Prove $\bfZ/mn \bfZ \cong \bfZ/m\bfZ \times \bfZ/n\bfZ$.
            \end{enumerate}
    \end{exercise}
        {\color{blue} \begin{proof}
            (1) Define $\phi:G \rightarrow G/H \rightarrow G/K$ by $\phi(g) = (gH,gK)$. \nl
            
            \noindent (2) Suppose $x \in H \cap K$. Then $x \in H$ and $x \in K$. So $\div{o(x)}{|H|}$ and $\div{o(x)}{|K|}$. This means $\div{o(x)}{\gcd(|H|,|K|)}$. Since $\gcd(|H|,|K|) = 1$, it must be the case that $o(x) = 1$; i.e., $x = e$. Thus $H \cap K = \{e\}$.
            
            By the First Isomorphism Theorem, $G/\ker\phi \cong \Image \phi$. Observe that:
                \begin{equation*}
                \begin{split}
                    \ker \phi  
                    & = \{g \in G \mid \phi(g) = (H,K)\} \\
                    & = \{g \in G \mid (gH,gK) = (H,K)\} \\
                    & = \{g \in G \mid g \in H, g \in K\} \\
                    & = H \cap K \\
                    & = \{e\}.
                \end{split}
                \end{equation*}
            Since $\ker \phi$ is trivial and $\Image \phi \leq G/H \times G/K$, $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $G/H \times G/K$. \nl
            
            \noindent (3) Define $\varphi : \bfZ \rightarrow \bfZ/m\bfZ \times \bfZ/n\bfZ$ by $x \mapsto ([x]_m,[x]_n)$. This is a homomorphism since:
                \begin{equation*}
                \begin{split}
                    \varphi(x+y)
                    & = ([x+y]_m,[x+y]_n) \\
                    & = ([x]_m + [y]_m,[x]_n + [y]_n) \\
                    & = ([x]_m,[x]_n) + ([y]_m,[y]_n) \\
                    & = \varphi(x) + \varphi(y).
                \end{split}
                \end{equation*}
            Let $([a]_m,[b]_n) \in \bfZ/m\bfZ \times \bfZ/n\bfZ$. Since $\gcd(m,n)=1$, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, for all $a,b \in \bfZ$ with $0 \leq a < n$ and $0 \leq b < m$, there exists a unique $x \in \bfZ$ such that $x \equiv a \pmod{m}$ and $x \equiv b \pmod{n}$. This is equivalent $x = a + sm$ and $x = b + tn$ for some $s,t \in \bfZ$. Using these equations for $x$, we can see:
                \begin{equation*}
                \begin{split}
                    \varphi(x)
                    & = ([x]_m,[x]_n) \\
                    & = ([a+sm]_m,[b+tn]_n) \\
                    & = ([a]_m,[b]_n).
                \end{split}
                \end{equation*}
            Whence $\varphi$ is surjective. Furthermore:
                \begin{equation*}
                \begin{split}
                    \ker \phi 
                    & = \{x \in \bfZ \mid \varphi(x) = ([0]_m,[0]_n) \} \\
                    & = \{x \in \bfZ \mid ([x]_m,[x]_n) = ([0]_m,[0]_n)\} \\
                    & = \{x \in \bfZ \mid [x]_m = [0]_m, [x]_n = [0]_n\} \\
                    & = \{x \in \bfZ \mid x \equiv 0\pmod{m}, x \equiv 0 \pmod{n} \} \\
                    & = \{x \in \bfZ \mid x = sm, x = tn, s,t \in \bfZ \} \\
                    & = \{x \in \bfZ \mid \div{m}{x}, \div{n}{x} \} \\
                    & = \{x \in \bfZ \mid \div{mn}{x} \} \h9\text{\tiny Since $\gcd(m,n) = 1$} \\
                    & = \{x \in \bfZ \mid x = (mn)s, s \in \bfZ\} \\
                    & = mn\bfZ.
                \end{split}
                \end{equation*}
            By the First Isomorphism Theorem, $\bfZ/mn\bfZ \cong \bfZ/m\bfZ \times \bfZ/n\bfZ$.
        \end{proof}}

    \begin{exercise}
        Let $G$ be a finite group and $Z(G)$ denote its center.
        \begin{enumerate}[label = (\arabic*),itemsep=1pt,topsep=3pt]
            \item Prove that if $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic, then $G$ is abelian.
            \item Prove that if $G$ is nonabelian, then $|Z(G)| \leq \frac{1}{4}|G|$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{exercise}
        {\color{blue} \begin{proof}
            (1) If $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic, there exists $aZ(G) \in G/Z(G)$ such that $\langle aZ(G) \rangle = G/Z(G)$. Let $gZ(G) \in G/Z(G)$. Then $gZ(G) = a^{k_1}Z(G)$ for some $k_1 \in \bfZ$. Equivalently, $(a^{k_1})^{-1}g \in Z(G)$, so there exists $z_1 \in Z(G)$ such that $(a^{k_1})^{-1}g = z_1$. Thus $g = z_1a^{k_1}$. Similarly for $hZ(G) \in G/Z(G)$, there exists $k_2 \in \bfZ$ and $z_2 \in Z(G)$ so that $h = z_2a^{k_2}$. Observe that:
                \begin{equation*}
                \begin{split}
                    gh 
                    & = z_1a^{k_1}z_2a^{k_2} \\
                    & = z_1 a^{k_1}a^{k_2}z_2 \\
                    & = z_1 a^{k_1 + k_2}z_2 \\
                    & = z_2 a^{k_1 + k_2}z_1 \\
                    & = z_2 a^{k_2}a^{k_1}z_1 \\
                    & = z_2a^{k_2}z_1a^{k_1} \\
                    & = hg.
                \end{split}
                \end{equation*}
            Thus $G$ is abelian. \nl
            
            \noindent (2) By Lagrange's Theorem, $4 \leq \frac{|G|}{|Z(G)|} = |G/Z(G)|$. Suppose towards contradiction $G$ is nonabelian and $|G/Z(G)| < 4$. If $|G/Z(G)| = 1$, then $G/Z(G)$ is trivial, so $G/Z(G) = Z(G)$. That means for every $g \in G$, $gZ(G) = Z(G)$, hence $g \in Z(G)$. But because $G = Z(G)$, $G$ must be abelian, which is a contradiction. For the cases where $|G/Z(G)| = 2$ and $|G/Z(G)| = 3$, note that $G/Z(G)$ will be cyclic since their orders are prime. Since $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic, $G$ is abelian, which again is a contradiction. It must be the case that $|G/Z(G)| \geq 4$; i.e., $|Z(G)| \leq \frac{1}{4}|G|$.

        Let $G$ be a group, $m \in \bfN$, and $g \in G$ be an element such that $g^m = e$. Prove that $o(g) \mid m$, where $o(g)$ is the order of $g$.
    \end{exercise}
        {\color{blue} \begin{proof}
            Suppose $o(g) = k$. Then $g^k = e$. Apply the division algorithm to $m$ and $k$. There exists $q,r \in \bfZ$ so that $m = kq + r$, $0 \leq r < k$. This means:
                \begin{equation*}
                \begin{split}
                    e
                    & = g^m \\ 
                    & = g^{kq+r} \\
                    & = g^{kq}g^r \\
                    & = g^r.
                \end{split}
                \end{equation*}
            But since $o(g) = k$ and $0\leq r < k$, it must be the case that $r = 0$. Thus $m = kq$; i.e., $o(g)\mid m$.
